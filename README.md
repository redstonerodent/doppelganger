Minecraft data pack which makes an armor stand mirror your movements, intended for square dancing in Minecraft with 4-7 people.

To use: install like any data pack. Run `/function doppelganger:setmirrored` to make yourself mirrored, and `/function doppelganger:unsetmirrored` to turn it off. If it gets weird, `/function doppelganger:reset` should reset everything.

Caveats: currently mirrors around 0,0; you should put the center of the dance floor there. The item copying assumes the player is right handed.
